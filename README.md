# Physics Simulator

Welcome to the **Physics Simulator**, a dynamic and interactive physics engine built using vanilla JavaScript. This simulator offers a realistic portrayal of physical phenomena and includes a variety of features designed to mimic real-world physics accurately.

## Features

- **Collision Detection**: Accurate detection and response for collisions between objects.
- **Gravity**: Simulates the effect of gravity on objects, creating realistic motion.
- **Air and Ground Friction**: Models the resistance objects face when moving through air or sliding across surfaces.
- **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop capabilities for easy interaction and manipulation of objects.
- **Elasticity**: Realistic simulation of elastic collisions, allowing objects to bounce off each other.
- **Many More**: Additional features to enhance the simulation and provide a comprehensive physics experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Physics Simulator, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. No external libraries or dependencies are required!

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
