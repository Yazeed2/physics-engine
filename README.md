    <title>Physics Simulator</title>
    <description>Welcome to the <strong>Physics Simulator</strong>, a dynamic and interactive physics engine built using vanilla JavaScript. This simulator offers a realistic portrayal of physical phenomena and includes a variety of features designed to mimic real-world physics accurately.</description>
    
    <features>
        <feature>Collision Detection: Accurate detection and response for collisions between objects.</feature>
        <feature>Gravity: Simulates the effect of gravity on objects, creating realistic motion.</feature>
        <feature>Air and Ground Friction: Models the resistance objects face when moving through air or sliding across surfaces.</feature>
        <feature>Drag and Drop: Intuitive drag-and-drop capabilities for easy interaction and manipulation of objects.</feature>
        <feature>Elasticity: Realistic simulation of elastic collisions, allowing objects to bounce off each other.</feature>
        <feature>Many More: Additional features to enhance the simulation and provide a comprehensive physics experience.</feature>
    </features>
